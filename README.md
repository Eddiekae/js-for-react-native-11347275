In Task 1, we created the processArray function, which takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. This function utilizes the map method to iterate through the array and apply the appropriate transformation based on whether each number is even or odd.

Task 2 involved developing the formatArrayStrings function. This function accepts two arrays: one of strings and one of numbers (processed by processArray). It returns a new array of strings where each string is either fully capitalized if the corresponding number is even or converted to lowercase if the number is odd. This ensures that the formatting of each string is dependent on its associated number.

In Task 3, we built the createUserProfiles function, which combines an array of original names and an array of modified names to create user profiles. Each profile is an object containing an id (auto-incremented starting from 1), the originalName, and the modifiedName. This function aligns the original and modified names and assigns a unique identifier to each profile.
